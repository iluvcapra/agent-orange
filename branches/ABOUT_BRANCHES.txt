ABOUT THE BRANCHES
==================

branch_1 :
  
   branch_1 contains a bunch of modifications I Jamie have been working on, 
   mainly having to do with regularizing testing, so that fixes we do from
   here on do not break previous work we've done.  This is particularly
   important for the tagging system.

   Once the testing infrastructure is laid out, this branch will be merged 
   into the trunk and the test cases and test mechanisms will be useable
   for all who wish to commit back into a-o.

   (branch_1 was made the new trunk at rev 63 on June 27, 2006; it is no
   longer present in the branches dir.)
